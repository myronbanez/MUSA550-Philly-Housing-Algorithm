# Assignment #7

**NOTE: THIS ASSIGNMENT IS REQUIRED**

**Due Date: Wednesday 12/7 by end of the day**

## Part 1: Final project proposal

## Overview

Submit a short (1/2 to 1 page) proposal that outlines and describe your plan for the final project. The proposal should discuss the following aspects of the project:

- the data set(s) you wish to use in the project,
- the questions that you want to explore
- the analysis methods and techniques that you will use
- how the above items satisfy the requirements outlined in the [final project description](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2022/final-project)

The description of the final project can be found [here](https://github.com/MUSA-550-Fall-2022/final-project).

**Note:** if you are struggling to come up with ideas for datasets, analyses, etc, please reach out and we can discuss potential project ideas.

### Proposal Deliverable

Upload a word document, PDF, etc to the assignment's GitHub repository with your proposal.

### Note

For the moment, do not worry too much about how the visualizations/interactive maps will be hosted on the web. We will cover several methods for embedding your visualizations on the web in the coming weeks. These methods fall generally into three categories:

- embedding interactive altair/holoviews plots produced in Python
- creating an interactive dashboard of plots using a free-tier server to host your code

Much more on these methods in the coming weeks!
